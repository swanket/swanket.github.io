Below is my CV. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at my email address.

## Education
**September 2021 - May 2024**: M.Sc. Geophysics, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada<br>
**Supervisors**: Dr. A. Mark Jellinek, Dr. Catherine L. Johnson

**September 2015 - December 2021**: B.Sc. Geophysics, The University of British Columbia
## Work Experience
**January 2021 - May 2024**: Research Assistant, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada<br>
* Set up, perform and analyze analog geophysical experiments of sediment plume dynamics.
* Analyze magnetic signatures from satellite missions to Mercury to better understand the crustal magnetic field of the planet.
* Time series analysis comparing eruption and glacial history in West Antarctica. Numerical Modelling of thermal diffusion through the Earth’s crust.

**September 2021 - December 2023**: Teaching Assistant, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada<br>
Support the professor in teaching class, responsible for teaching group laboratories, mentor and tutor students, and grading homework and tests.

**May 2021 - August 2021**: Intern, GEI Consultants, Sacramento, California, USA<br>
As the only geophysicist on a team of geohydrologists, I was tasked with addressing the
geophysical tasks appointed to the project team. Worked with the geophysical surveying
subcontractor to better understand the groundwater availability in the state of California.

## Publications
Gilchrist, J.T., Jellinek, A.M., Hooft, E.E.E., Wanket, S.M. Submarine terraced deposits linked to periodic collapse of caldera-forming eruption columns. Nat. Geosci.16, 446–453 (2023). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-023-01160-z](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-023-01160-z)

## Professional Interests
I hope to use the skills I learned in my M.Sc. and B.Sc. to enhance sustainability and progress across any industry that I work in. I am interested in research focused on the physical and thermal interactions of ice sheets and glaciers on volcanic eruptions, physical oceanography and fluid dynamics, ground and surface water hydrology, and really anything Earth Science with a focus on sustainability and climate change. I am experienced and interested in using computer science to study physical processes that might be difficult to capture in field studies. I do not have fieldwork experience, however I would love to engage in fieldwork in the future because without solid data acquisition computer studies are impossible.

## Skills and Activities
**Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB, Julia, SQL, R 

**Software**: COMSOL, ArcGIS, QGIS

**Environemnts**: Latex, Microsoft: Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Access

**Technical skills**: Numerical Modelling, Statistical Analysis, Data and Time Series Processing, Data Visualisation, Data Manipulation
