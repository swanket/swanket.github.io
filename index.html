<h1>A bit about me...</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Sean Wanket. I am an avid surfer, diver, and runner. The picture above is me frozen to the bone after surfing eastern Lake Huron in a town called Goderich, Ontario. </p>

<p>Until recently, most of my time was spent studying the effects of melting glaciers on volcanic eruption frequency in Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica for my Master's of Science in Geophysics at The University of British Columbia. That work is discussed in more detail on M.Sc. Thesis page. Since finishing my M.Sc. in April, 2024 I have been working to publish a modified version of my thesis. That paper is currently in review.</p>

<p>For a few months after finishing my M.Sc. I was living in Canada as a US Citizen on a Visitor Record, which meant I could not legally work or volunteer for any Canadian employer. This gave me a unique opportunity to focus my time on anything I wanted. When I was not applying for jobs hoping that one would agree to sponsor me I picked up new hobbies on top of studying new subjects that I knew would be useful for me in the future. I discuss these new hobbies in the page "In my free time" and my extra studies in  the page "Always studying."</p>
