Hello! My name is Sean Wanket. I am an avid surfer, diver, and runner. The picture above is me frozen to the bone after surfing eastern Lake Huron in a town called Goderich, Ontario. 

Until recently, most of my time was spent studying the effects of melting glaciers on volcanic eruption frequency in Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica for my Master's of Science in Geophysics at The University of British Columbia. That work is discussed in more detail on M.Sc. Thesis page. Since finishing my M.Sc. in April, 2024 I have been working to publish the work. That paper is currently in review.
